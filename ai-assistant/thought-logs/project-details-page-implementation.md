# Project Details Page Implementation

## Overview
This session focused on implementing a full-screen project details page feature that allows users to click on any project in the portfolio and see a dedicated page with more detailed information about that project.

## Approach

1. **Created project-details.html**
   - Designed a clean, modern template for displaying project details
   - Structured the page with sections for project description, features, challenges, solutions, and outcomes
   - Added navigation with a back button to return to the main portfolio

2. **Styled project details page**
   - Created project-details.css with responsive design
   - Maintained consistency with the main portfolio's design language
   - Added visual appeal with structured content blocks and spacing

3. **Implemented interaction logic**
   - Created project-details.js with dynamic content loading based on URL parameters
   - Built a project data structure for each project (could be expanded to fetch from a database or JSON file)
   - Added functionality to populate the template with project-specific content

4. **Updated main portfolio interactions**
   - Made project cards clickable in script.js
   - Enhanced UI with hover effects and visual cues to indicate interactivity
   - Ensured consistent "View Project" text across all project cards

## Technical Decisions

- Used URL parameters to pass project IDs between pages, enabling clean navigation
- Created a scalable data structure for projects that could be expanded to include more details
- Implemented responsive design that works across device sizes
- Added subtle animations and transitions for a polished user experience

## Future Enhancements

- Could add image galleries for each project
- Might implement a carousel or slider for project screenshots
- Could add video demonstrations of projects in action
- Consider adding testimonials or user feedback for each project

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully creates a seamless experience where users can navigate from the portfolio overview to detailed project information and back. The design maintains consistency while providing enough space to showcase project details, challenges, and outcomes.
