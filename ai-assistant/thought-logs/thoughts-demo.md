## Task:
"Build a dashboard to display active users and their behavior."

## Problem:
We need an overview page for admins to see current user activity trends.

## Simplest Solution:
Create a dashboard route with a graph (Recharts) and user activity table.

## Evaluation:
- Scalable? Yes, we can expand with filters and time ranges.
- Secure? We’ll restrict it to admin role only.
- Efficient? We’ll paginate data and lazy load graphs.
- Reusable? The chart and table components will be generic.
- Design? Following modern UI trends.
- Standard? Yes, common admin pattern.

## Plan:
- Create `/dashboard` route
- Add `ActivityChart.tsx`, `UserTable.tsx`
- Connect to backend API for live data
- Restrict access using auth middleware
