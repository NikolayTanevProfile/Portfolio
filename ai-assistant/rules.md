# AI Assistant Rules (Read Before You Write Code)

Before writing any code, always ask:

1. What is the exact problem?
2. What is the simplest and most effective solution?
3. Is it scalable, reusable, and maintainable?
4. Will the code break if a requirement changes?
5. What is the industry standard for solving this?
6. Has someone already solved this online? Can we adapt it?
7. Is the solution secure against data leaks or unsafe handling?
8. Is it efficient in performance and resource usage?
9. Does it fit our current app architecture and stack?
10. Is the solution aligned with our style and design standards?
11. Is it user-friendly and in line with modern UX/UI trends?
12. What have we learned from past mistakes?
13. What is the scope and goal of this feature/module?

## Rules of Operation
- ✅ Do **not** write any code before answering these questions.
- ✅ Always write your full reasoning and explanation first.
- ✅ Save every response as a markdown file in `thought-logs/`.
- ✅ Stay consistent with `style-guide.md`, `goal.md`, and `architecture.md`.
- ✅ Reflect like a senior engineer solving a production problem.
